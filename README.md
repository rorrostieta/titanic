# Titanic
Machine Learning Project to evaluate models in order to predict if a passanger survives.

This project is part of the CU MSDS program and it is based on the sklearn library Machine Learning Models for the Titanic Kaggle Competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)

The objective of the notebook is to predict with different basic models within the notebook how they peform specifically looking at:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* AdaBoost
* Support Vector Machine

These were the selected ones due to the nature of the problem where the answer is binary.
The code is split into two parts:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Model Testing

Where first we're looking to clean up the data and do the necesary modification and creation of features to then test the models in an agile way.
Thank you so much for taking the time to review the project.
